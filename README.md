# DnD-Dungeon-Master-Simulation

This project was developed for CSS 458 at University of Washington Bothell, during spring quarter of 2025.

It models a simulated Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) combat scenario using an agent-based, grid-based approach. The goal is to explore how different configurations of player characters (PCs) and enemy non-player characters (NPCs), along with varied strategic behaviors, affect the enjoyment and pacing of combat encounters. Specifically, the simulation focuses on measuring the length of combat rounds, damage dealt and received, and emergent patterns of interaction, to identify optimal combinations of enemy count, composition, and tactics that lead to the most engaging gameplay experience. 

Dungeons & Dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game first published in 1974, relies heavily on the Dungeon Master (DM) to create and manage encounters. In combat, the DM orchestrates the behavior of enemies in response to player actions. While the game is deeply narrative and improvisational, combat sequences are structured around rules governing initiative, movement, actions, and damage, making them a viable candidate for agent-based simulation. In this project, a simulated DM agent will generate and execute combat encounters under different scenarios, enabling statistical analysis of their outcomes. 

The phenomenon being modeled, combat enjoyment and balance in turn-based RPG systems, has been explored in various academic and game design contexts. Yee (2006) highlighted that combat pacing and strategic depth are key components of enjoyment in roleplaying games. Adams and Rollings (2007) describe combat mechanics as a central feature of player engagement, with balance and variety being critical to long-term interest. More recently, Togelius et al. (2011) have shown that simulations and procedural content generation can be used to optimize game design elements such as enemy placement and difficulty scaling. 

Most existing research has focused on modeling players or generating content automatically, but this project shifts focus to the Dungeon Masterâ€™s role. By simulating a DM agent that runs battles using different enemy strategies and group compositions, the simulation can test how these changes influence key aspects of gameplay, like pacing, fairness, and engagement. For example, the simulation will analyze how tactics such as concentrating attacks on one player or spreading damage across the party affect the overall flow and enjoyment of combat. The goal is to identify patterns that consistently lead to satisfying and well-balanced encounters. Insights from this simulation could help game designers and DMs alike create more enjoyable and dynamic combat experiences, whether in traditional tabletop sessions or digital adaptations.
